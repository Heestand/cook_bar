? select_cook_bar_bg1 is created for some reason
- remove select top when self destruct is triggerd even if the top is in a different network
- border is one pix to far away
+ only turn display off on tops
? save script... if main cook bar comp not saved and select op saved, not good
- decide if cut of limit will trim or stop all ops from working
- clamp min max in Maxopcount
> clean up failed select tops
? motionhacker or me
? random spikes in cook level when panning in the network
